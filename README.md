Visual representation of the [Mandelbrot fractal(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), one of the most widely known pieces of mathematical art. It is the go-to example of an incredibly complex structure resulting from applying very simple rules.

I also tried my hand at multi threaded computation to see the impact a little optimization can have on CPU intensive jobs.

## How to use

Hold Z and click (don't drag) to create a rectangle that will be zoomed in

Press Space to toggle between single core and multi core computation
